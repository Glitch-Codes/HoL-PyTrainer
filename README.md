High on Life trainer written in Python with the intentions of deploying as a Windows Executable

The main goal for this project is to produce something usable with the CheatDeck DeckyLoader plugin for the Steamdeck and Steamdeck-like devices running something like BazziteOS

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. CHEATS MAY OR MAY NOT WORK, THEY MAY ALSO CRASH YOUR GAME.

Running this script: python .\trainer_gui.py
